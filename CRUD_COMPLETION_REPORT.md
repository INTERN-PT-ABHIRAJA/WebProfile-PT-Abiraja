## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### ❌ Route Naming Inconsistency
**Problem:** Routes were defined as `.destroy` but some views were calling `.delete`
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed all route references to use consistent `.destroy` naming

### ❌ Variable Naming Mismatch
**Problem:** Products edit view used `$product` while forms expected `$item`
**Solution:** ✅ Updated BaseDashboardController to pass multiple variable names for backward compatibility

### ❌ Missing Form Files
**Problem:** Some modules had incomplete form components
**Solution:** ✅ Created/updated all form.blade.php files with proper field handling

### ❌ Cache Issues
**Problem:** Route changes not reflected due to caching
**Solution:** ✅ Cleared all caches (route, config, view, application)
